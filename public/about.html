<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, I'm Elizabeth. I am working through a self-paced web development
  course. I will be creating multiple projects to add to my portfolio. My
  portfolio will showcase what I have learned and accomplished throughout the
  course. I'm making it a goal for myself to make a career change to something
  that I find fascinating and really enough doing.
</p>
<p>
  I love learning and solving problems. Which, with web development, I can
  continue to do. Programming languages are constantly changing and we need to
  adapt with it and learn it. I love the satisfaction of running into a problem
  and being able to really think about how to fix it.
</p>

<p>
  I am a fast learner and great at working as a team. Although my previous work
  experience is completely different from web development, is has allowed me to
  get experience in working with an amazing team. Through that I have also
  mastered my time management skill and learned to prioritize certain tasks over
  others.
